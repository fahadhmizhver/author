    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Mohammed Fahadh Khambrath (professionally known as MD. Fahadh MizhVer or simply MizhVer) is an English author born and raised in Malappuram, Kerala, India. He writes under the professional name MD. Fahadh MizhVer.
      <br><br>
      From a young age, he showed a strong interest in reading, particularly in books about human psychology, behavior, and power dynamics. His approach to writing came from personal observations on how people think, react, and function within systems of power and influence.
      <br><br>
      At the age of seventeen, MizhVer wrote and published his first book, <em>9 Essays That Will Change The Way You Think</em>. The book presented his early ideas on strategic thinking, perception, and behavioral patterns. It marked the beginning of his work examining how control operates, how influence is built, and how psychological mechanisms shape human interaction.
      <br><br>
      His writing focuses on psychology, power, and the mechanics of human behavior. He works with historical records and documented cases to examine how individuals position themselves, build dependency systems, convert opposition into advantage, and create influence without formal authority. His research draws from multiple cultures and time periods, including Byzantine, Islamic, Chinese, Indian, European, and African histories.
      <br><br>
      MizhVer describes his work not as self-help, but as a study of control, strategy, and the hidden structures that govern human affairs. His approach is to present what actually happened in history, what people actually did, and what results those actions produced. The focus is on practical application backed by evidence rather than theory.
      <br><br>
      He continues to research and write, developing works that examine strategic positioning, psychological warfare, and the methods people use to shape behavior and outcomes. His writing presents structured understanding of influence, authority, and the systems people build to maintain power.
